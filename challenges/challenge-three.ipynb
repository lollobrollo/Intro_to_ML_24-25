    "    * Provide a grid plot of the first 10/12 examples with associated labels\n",
    "    * Split using the provided pytorch objects into train/validation/test sets\n",
    "2. For each architecture, tune the number of the hidden layers ($\\le 3$), the optimizer, and some hyperparameters of your choice. How many tries to do is up to your discretion. Discuss the choice you made in the report.\n",
    "3. Summarise your results in a table and comment on them in the report. \n",
    "4. For a model (not necessarily the best performing one), plot training loss vs testing loss and training accuracy vs testing accuracy, and comment on what you see.\n",
    "    * Beyond accuracy provide the confusion matrix for the model outputs. Discuss differences between train/validation/test sets. Is accuracy a good metric in this case why or why not?"
